I have to write a brief introduction for what this current project is and what skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed it. - Most of this will have to wait until the end but this is going to be a basic recipe website. I will use git, github, html, and at a later date, CSS, possibly java. In Visual Studio, in linux. I'm assuming this is what is needed here. Moving on.
